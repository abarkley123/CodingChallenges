# CodingInterview

This repository aims to serve as a guide toward acing the programming technical interview. This README acts as a launch-pad for deeper investigation into topics - links to fleshed out discussion of each section are included throughout.
Each demonstration will be written using **Java SE 8**, however the principles are transferable between languages.

# Data structures and algorithms

Data structures & algorithms are vital components for any techincal interview. These allow you to simplify complex problems and craft simple, efficient solutions.

## Data structures

### Tree

#### Graph

#### Trie

#### Binary Tree

### List

### Array

## Algorithms

### Dynamic Programming

## System design

### Design Patterns

Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. [https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns]. Therefore, these patterns are useful in helping to structure your thoughts during system design questions. 

The following common design patterns are covered:

- [Adapter](https://github.com/abarkley123/CodingInterview/blob/master/design/patterns/Adapter.java)
- [Builder](https://github.com/abarkley123/CodingInterview/blob/master/design/patterns/Builder.java)
- [Composite](https://github.com/abarkley123/CodingInterview/blob/master/design/patterns/Composite.java)
- [Decorator](https://github.com/abarkley123/CodingInterview/blob/master/design/patterns/Decorator.java)
- [Factory](https://github.com/abarkley123/CodingInterview/blob/master/design/patterns/Factory.java)
- [Observer](https://github.com/abarkley123/CodingInterview/blob/master/design/patterns/Observer.java)
- [Prototype](https://github.com/abarkley123/CodingInterview/blob/master/design/patterns/Prototype.java)
- [Singleton](https://github.com/abarkley123/CodingInterview/blob/master/design/patterns/Singleton.java)
- [Strategy](https://github.com/abarkley123/CodingInterview/blob/master/design/patterns/Strategy.java)
